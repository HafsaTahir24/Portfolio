Visual Learning is a learning style in which a person learns through visual aids such as charts, graphs, diagrams, and
  more. Visual learners rely on seeing and observing in order to understand and learn new information. They may have
  difficulty with verbal instructions and may benefit from seeing information presented in a visual format. Visual
  learners often benefit from using color-coded notes, flashcards, and other visual aids to help them remember
  information. They may also benefit from creating visual representations of information, such as mind maps and
  diagrams. Visual learners are good at remembering faces and places, and may benefit from using visual cues to help
  them remember information. Visual learners may also benefit from using visual association techniques to help them
  remember information.

 Auditory Learning is a learning style in which a person learns through listening.
 An auditory learner relies on hearing and speaking as a main way of learning.
  Auditory learners must be able to hear what is being said in order to understand
   and may have difficulty with written instructions.
    They also use their listening and repeating skills to sort through the information that is sent to them. Auditory learners often benefit from reading text aloud and using a tape recorder. They may also benefit from creating musical jingles to help them remember information. Auditory learners are good at writing responses to lectures they have heard. They may also benefit from working in groups and discussing information with others. Auditory learners may also benefit from using word association techniques to help them remember information.
